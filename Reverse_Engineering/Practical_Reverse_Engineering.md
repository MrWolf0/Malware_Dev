#Difference between (Real mode VS the processor state)
**Real mode is the processor state**
when it is first powered on and only supports a 16-bit instruction set.<br>
**Protected**
mode is the processor state supporting virtual memory, paging, and other
features; it is the state in which modern operating systems execute.<br>
**ECX**
 Counter in loops<br>
**ESI**
 Source in string/memory operations<br>
**EDI**
 Destination in string/memory operations<br>
**EBP**
 Base frame pointer<br>
**ESP**
 Stack pointer<br>
 While x86 does not have 64-bit GPRs, it can combine two registers, usually EDX:EAX, and treat them as 64-bit values in some sce- narios. For example, the RDTSC instruction writes a 64-bit value to EDX:EAX.<br>
 The 32-bit EFLAGS register is used to store the status of arithmetic operations and other execution states (e.g., trap flag). For example, if the previous “add” operation resulted in a zero, the ZF flag will be set to 1. The flags in EFLAGS are primarily used to implement conditional branching.<br>
 CR0: This register controls whether the system is using a feature called "paging," which is part of how the computer manages memory. If paging is on, the system can use more memory than is physically available by swapping data to and from the hard drive.<br>

CR2: When the system encounters a memory error called a "page fault" (which happens when the system tries to access data that isn’t in memory), this register stores the address that caused the error. This helps the system figure out what went wrong.<br>

CR3: This register holds the starting point (or base address) of a data structure that the system uses to manage paging. Essentially, it helps the system know where to look for information on how memory is organized.<br>

CR4: This one controls various advanced settings, like those related to hardware virtualization (which is when the system runs virtual machines, allowing multiple operating systems to run on the same hardware).<br>

DR0–DR7: These registers are used for debugging, specifically to set "memory breakpoints." A memory breakpoint lets you pause the execution of a program when it accesses a specific part of memory, which is useful for finding and fixing bugs.<br>
